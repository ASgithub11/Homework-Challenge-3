## Usage

User can add mutiple employees to employee roster by clicking on "Add Employees" button and entering the employee information in the prompt windows. A user can input as many employees as they want as there is no limit to the number of rows that can be entered. Once user is done entering the information, they can click on "Cancel" button which closes the prompt window and employees first name, last name and their annual salary is displayed in the employee roster table.
